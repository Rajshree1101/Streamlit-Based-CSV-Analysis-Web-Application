I've developed a web application using Streamlit, designed to empower users in analyzing CSV data through a user-friendly interface.
Utilized the query_agent function to process CSV data and  interpret user queries.
Used OpenAI's language model interprets  analyze and executes user queries. 
I deployed and hosted this application on AWS using EC2 function
